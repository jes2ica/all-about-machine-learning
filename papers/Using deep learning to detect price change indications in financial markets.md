# Introduction
- Proposal of a deep learning methodology, based on recurrent neural networks.
- Predicting future mid-price movements from large-scale high-frequency limit order data.

# Related Work
- Deep Portfolio Theory: autoencoders to optimize the performance of a portfolio.
- Application using high frequency limit orderbook (LOB): 
  - Handcrafted features such as price differences, bid-ask spreads and price and volumn derivatives.
  - SVM -> predict whether the mid-price will move upwards or downward in the near future.
